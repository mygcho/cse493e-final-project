1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
You may see teams in general meetings. So yeah, I'll just click.


2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Yeah, so this is our info session. We'll be talking about what we do outside of what you may see in general meetings.


3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:18.000
You may know like we sit in like our little corner during our general meetings, but we have actually like a leadership team that we help with like planning events.


4
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And mainly just making the project team experience a lot more valuable. I mean, making sure we build upon feedback to make it a good experience for you all so We have started.


5
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So introducing us, we have a few leads presenting as you can see with our cameras on. Feel free to also turn your camera on.


6
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We love to see your faces, especially if you're thinking of applying. But yeah, we have Katie and I as co-chairs.


7
00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Elizabeth is here for our finance team. Sam is here from our tech team, Colin and Kevin are here from onboarding.


8
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:17.000
We have Selma for communications. And then we have NET for for a design. I think she'll come into the section soon, but we'll cover the design team section if any of you are interested.


9
00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Oh shoot, yeah, we was back from education to you.


10
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
And then we also have ZAC, which is not on the slide, but. So you know.


11
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Okay, our club mission and vision. You may have seen this like sentence on our website, but we hope to create like a tech like internship.


12
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Or a tech internship like environment that promotes the growth and development of our club members. So we want to help with providing team-based programming project experience and encouraged peer to peer learning across that.


13
00:01:46.000 --> 00:02:06.000
So a lot of your experience will depend on your team members, but we hope to let that be an easy transition for people starting out with a new project team idea and allow them to work well with the team and from then on at some point teams become pretty like independent so we're just helping them start up.


14
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So a lot of our work, we get pretty busy fall in winter quarter. Spring tends to be more chill only because project teams are well established then.


15
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Our vision is to drive the, provide the next generation of programmers and designers with the tools and experience to succeed in future tech careers.


16
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So we hope that this project is a result that they can put in portfolios. Something that can help them get like a 1st internship.


17
00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Now we do like hear a lot of feedback that this is a case and we hope that we can continue that.


18
00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:45.000
For the future tech market and we're starting to, instead of move from like the programming focus and we are also focusing on design and product management.


19
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
So that is also something we're trying to improve on. For HCP. And our values, we have 4 main values.


20
00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:09.000
To listen, that, freedom to fail, turn talk to action and respect for all folks. We hope that with in this leadership team, this is something we value and we hope that we can reflect that onto our members.


21
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Yeah, so these are some of our complete expectations. Our clubly hierarchy is very flat, so the coacher is meaning and I and then there are club leads which is potentially all of you.


22
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.000
We are thinking about implementing like heads for each. So team, but. That's something that we haven't decided on yet.


23
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Each team is responsible for their own work. So each team, has a list of things. To do in the beginning of the year for example education team will host workshops and that will be their task for the year or the quarter.


24
00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:52.000
And then we have a detailed breakdown of time commitments in our documentation on our documentation website that we'll go into later.


25
00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:05.000
And then another expectation that we have is meeting with Manila and I for our weekly one on ones, which are just 15 min meetings, just to sync up with me.


26
00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Yeah. And to add on to this as like a good note, and we should have updated this slide with this like information, but, doing the sync and making sure you're responsible for like your own team like roles.


27
00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:25.000
So usually you'll have like a once a week meeting with the co chair. It's just your whole team with like a co-chair sync.


28
00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So this is like really short as Katie mentioned, but if you have other commitments that your team needs to fulfill and complete before like a specific amount of time, you will often just meet separately with just your team and work on that.


29
00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:53.000
So it is like your commitment, your responsibility to make sure you attend those meetings. So general expectations is you have to communicate with your team obviously and let them know if you can't make anything.


30
00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:59.000
But it's just like your own time. So general meetings you may see leads go to general meetings but it's not actually a strict like rule for you to attend if you're a club lead.


31
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Obviously we encourage it because you will meet your team members, but we'll talk about that more later.


32
00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:12.000
As a requirement.


33
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:27.000
Another thing I wanted to mention is that we Obviously we're all students here as we understand if you can't commit as much time every single week because of midterms or finals and we completely understand that so don't feel like These are very strict requirements.


34
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000
We just want you to communicate if you can't make it.


35
00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Yeah.


36
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000
Yeah, a lot of times even like Katie and I can't make like a few things. Just like as long as like your team knows, it's all good and we know you're busy.


37
00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:44.000
So. Yeah. Okay, we'll move on to our club lead roles. So we have 6 different teams.


38
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:57.000
We've definitely expanded. We have education onboarding slash like club project leak guide communications technology finance and design and we have the link to our documentation.


39
00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000
It is the same link you use for your project team documentation, but you see the tab to the right, we have leadership docs.


40
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:09.000
So everything we mentioned here is actually on our website. So we'll start off with Zack or sorry.


41
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.000
Yeah, Colin and Kevin for onboarding.


42
00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:25.000
All right, I guess if we start with onboarding, basically. Onboarding job is basically get people who join the club who probably don't know what they're doing onto self sufficient project teams.


43
00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:33.000
And basically how we do this is often we have information days you might remember we help form people who Just join the club into project teams.


44
00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.000
We guide them. So they can get started with their project to help them plan the stack, plan their pitch.


45
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I think the way around but you get just And yeah, and then we ultimately get them. Hi, ideally into a state where they can.


46
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.000
Be self-sufficient and we just need to check into them. So I guess some key things about onboarding is.


47
00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:06.000
Yeah, as the 1st book says mainly it's a lot of work in the beginning of fall and winter quarter and doing fall quarter when you need to like a lot more hand holding the workload definitely goes down.


48
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:17.000
As the year goes on. And yeah, and we also plan social events too, which we hope will become quarterly instead of annually now.


49
00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:25.000
Do you all hope to share your screen for like the documentation?


50
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000
Or I can share it as well, that's easier.


51
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.000
Oh, yeah, If I don't have pulled up.


52
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:43.000
Okay. Okay. Okay, well it links to our documentation. I think we Let me go back to our slides.


53
00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:52.000
I think we have a separate for onboarding it's on a Google Docs since we couldn't update our official documentation for that but do any of you have that up but right now or We can just talk about.


54
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000
I can. Find it maybe


55
00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000
Okay.


56
00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:03.000
Yeah.


57
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Yeah, the thing about onboarding role is like it changes pretty frequently. So because they're responsible for Team Formation Day, usually there's a lot of like quick thinking involved the day of Team Formation Day.


58
00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:26.000
So if you all have been involved in project teams recently, you see Colin like quickly like getting ideas together, using his voice to like make sure that people are in like the right spots.


59
00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:43.000
So a lot of it, you get kind of your own separate role during TFD as like an onboarding lead but Your like biggest role will be to look after the project teams because you will be like mentoring.


60
00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:50.000
Like. 3 to 4 or like 2 to 4 project teams like per quarter. So that is like you usually the expectation.


61
00:08:50.000 --> 00:09:01.000
But their role is like pretty, it varies depending on what the team needs. But if you are interested in working more directly with the project teams onboarding is the role for you.


62
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:12.000
They're like the most involved with communicating with our project teams and giving them that mentorship and advice to move forward.


63
00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:17.000
If you can't find that documentation, it's OK. If there's anything else to add, you'll like.


64
00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:18.000
Colin, Kevin. Yeah, it's okay.


65
00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:24.000
Yeah, I can't really find it, but. I think we covered everything I have in mind.


66
00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:30.000
Okay, sounds good.


67
00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:35.000
Alright, now we go back for education.


68
00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:49.000
Okay, so. For education team, our main thing is doing workshops. That's basically, we'll try aim for about one to 2 workshops.


69
00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:57.000
We got here listed some of the past workshops within the past year. So. We've done this gate command line workshop.


70
00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:05.000
3 times now within the past like 2 years. And then, some of these were before I was here.


71
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:14.000
Ones that we did while within the past year was. We did a workshop club with Edgy Hacks.


72
00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:34.000
Hackathon and we taught how to do API calls to open AI. And. We also did the technical interview workshop last quarter where we had Casey come in and talk about the technical interview process and do some really code problems.


73
00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:52.000
The main, role or the main like duties of an education club lead. Is designing workshops, planning them, and then giving them but there's also a few.


74
00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:10.000
Things required of that like We're going to go to, we have bike requirements for every workshop where we must do a drive run of like beforehand schedule a dry one just to make a workshops like better and everyone's kinda more on track.


75
00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:21.000
And then also there is a petros for every workshop. So after we do the workshop we have to come together and talk about what went well and what could do better so that we do it again in the future.


76
00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:28.000
We hope they make it better. Nice. See, we got the. Team dogs pulled up here.


77
00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:45.000
See other time commitments are about you got your general meeting and then the Meetups the syncs with the club rates and then also preparation for the individual workshops depending on if they're like currently actively working on a workshop.


78
00:11:45.000 --> 00:12:00.000
Sometimes would not like always actually working on a workshop. But. Yeah.


79
00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000
So. Don't know this anything else.


80
00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:10.000
I don't think so. You mentioned all the workshops. Many workshops too, so I's like you all have been like everywhere around campus from general meetings to like clubbing with other organizations.


81
00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:22.000
That's really cool role to take if you like learning something new. And if you like teaching as well.


82
00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:37.000
Alright, and I do wanna know, I guess one thing. It says it in the documents too, I believe it talks about you should be able to, like a lot of things we percent on or if we come up with an idea of a workshop, do my not fully understand the idea when we come up with it.


83
00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:50.000
So kind of the Learn along the way to make sure you know enough to present the ideas. I think that's also important to be able to do for this.


84
00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:57.000
Alright, thanks, Zuck.


85
00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:02.000
Selma for communications and outreach.


86
00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:12.000
Yeah, hi guys. So communication, like our role primarily consists of, and I, by the way, I work with, Emily.


87
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:22.000
She's the other, lead on the communications team. So we mainly work on our social media for the club.


88
00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.000
So like posting, on Instagram for upcoming events. Or past events like doing posting pictures about past events.


89
00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:36.000
Working on, we're currently working on like spotlighting our project teams and kind of making posts to kind of showcase teams that are doing well.


90
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:46.000
Like back at the beginning of the year, we also, did a little bit of outreach work for.


91
00:13:46.000 --> 00:14:15.000
The showcase, like reaching out to people to invite them, but mainly it's really just working on our social media and also, maintaining contacts with other clubs that you dub, who might ask us to like post about one of their events on our Instagram so we kind of maintain relations with other clubs but yeah, other than that, it's pretty straightforward.


92
00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:24.000
And the time commitment throughout the. Year and throughout the quarters. Is pretty consistent. Oh yeah, thank you for pulling up the doc.


93
00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:39.000
So. Yeah, like it's really a small, short, incremental task like the ones you see, you know, drafting an email for outreach or just designing a post.


94
00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:46.000
And so I definitely say because a lot of it is. Designing Instagram posts, it does take a little bit of like an eye for.


95
00:14:46.000 --> 00:15:01.000
I guess graphic design, but so if that sounds at all interesting like communications might be. A cool place for you.


96
00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000
Thanks, Selma.


97
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:13.000
Alright. And then Sam for tech team.


98
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:23.000
Hey guys, so the tech team really just helps the students and the team just make sure that they're not stuck on a So we mainly help the team set up their GitHub.


99
00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:32.000
And after that, we just helped them with any other technology related things that they might have. Like if they're stuck on, if there's error that they have.


100
00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:38.000
And they can't figure that out themselves like a week or so, and they just come up to us and can help them.


101
00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:47.000
We also help, just students during the general meeting if they have any questions related to that. And that's our main, task.


102
00:15:47.000 --> 00:16:00.000
And other than that, we also do technology really stuff for the club like make the websites we made the box We also have made a disc robot to help.


103
00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:14.000
Remind. And if you wanna show the docs stage, you know.


104
00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:22.000
So all this, documentation page. Was made by tech team.


105
00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:32.000
We bought the domain we got the We hosted the domain. We've written everything out and we've.


106
00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:42.000
Make sure it's posted on the web. And for the time commitments, it really varies between various, quarterly.


107
00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:52.000
Because in the fall, we usually don't have that much things going on since. Teams are the same stuff I've been getting the talks ready in the winter and spring.


108
00:16:52.000 --> 00:17:00.000
We do get a bit more work on our hands, so maybe like a couple of hours. But other than that, I think it's a really good.


109
00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:13.000
Team lead team and I hope some of you guys want to join the tech team.


110
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000
Okay, thanks, Sam. Okay, then Elizabeth for Finance.


111
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000
Hi, so I'm part of finance, but basically on finance we manage the finance of the club so that mainly involves a lot of just funding for our events.


112
00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:36.000
We personally, we have to apply to grants to get fun to come to school and currently we became an affiliate RSO for that.


113
00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:47.000
That was another one of our ways of getting funding for our events. But basically it's keeping track of all of our budgets and bank accounts and how much one we have left and this also what involves hosting fundraisers who also earn more money for our club.


114
00:17:47.000 --> 00:18:03.000
So we usually try to do one or 2 fundraisers per quarter and I don't know if you guys remember the past ones that we done like model fundraiser, Chipotle, and we did one that we sold Costco muffins and turrows in the quad and that was really fun.


115
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:10.000
But it's like these little, events that we try to plan on every quarter. It's pretty chill.


116
00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.000
Besides like the weekly sync meetings you should only really expect like one to 2 h of work every week.


117
00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:24.000
But it's really fun and I think another thing that we do wanna try to still go for is forming partnerships or sponsorship with other companies.


118
00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:30.000
That's kind of been in the waters, but I think, from starting from like next we can definitely push for that a bit harder.


119
00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:39.000
But yeah, that's basically what finance does.


120
00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:44.000
Thanks.


121
00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:45.000
Okay. Alright, and then not sure if there is here for design. I'm just taking a quick look.


122
00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:53.000
Okay.


123
00:18:53.000 --> 00:19:02.000
Yeah, all good. So, this design team, we don't have documentation because they actually just started off their team like the past quarter.


124
00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:09.000
So, actually this quarter. So like this and past quarter, it's a new team for HTTP.


125
00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:27.000
They actually weren't like they didn't exist when we 1st found it. So, their role is still like kind of getting documented, which is why we don't have the link right now, but, for the most part design team was made to improve the visual aspects and the user experience for our projects.


126
00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:38.000
So you may have noticed for if you've been like on a project team recently, design team was really involved in providing feedback for FIGMA designs.


127
00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.000
