## Prerequisites ‚ÄºÔ∏è

1. Install the required dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

```bash
 pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The requirements file contains all of the programs and libraries being used for the project, and is especially 
needed for the Gradio frontend Python library and the Hugging Face models used for PlainScribe.

## Development üíª

To start the development environment, follow these steps:

1. Start your server (from the root of the project):

```bash
python main.py
```

The main.py file contains the start-up scripts for both the front and back end, and will start up the Hugging Face
configs. Open up the application locally through 'http://127.0.0.1:7860/'.
